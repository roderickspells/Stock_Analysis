# stock-analysis
 


## Project Overview

The purpose of this project was to create a workbook with VBA so that Steve could quickly analyze data from 12 stocks for the years 2017 and 2018 so that he could advise his parents on potential investments.
We also refactored the code, collecting the same data but to determine whether we could improve our script and make it run faster and more efficiently.

## Results

### Stock Analysis

- As seen in the charts, in 2017 all stocks hada positive return with the exception of TERP. 75% of the stocks had a return that was greater than 20%
- In 2018, 83.3% hada negative return - the only stocks to post a positive return were ENPH and RUN
- Out of all the stocks, ENPH performed consistently in both years

## Summary
 
Refactoring is a key part of the coding process. When refactoring code, you aren’t adding new functionality; you just want to make the code more efficient—by taking fewer steps, using less memory, or improving the logic of the code to make it easier for future users to read. Refactoring is common on the job because first attempts at code won’t always be the best way to accomplish a task. Sometimes, refactoring someone else’s code will be your entry point to working with the existing code at a job.
